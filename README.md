## Technologies Used

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications.
- **Vite**: A fast and modern development build tool that provides an enhanced development experience with instant updates and fast build times.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows you to rapidly build custom designs without leaving your HTML.

## Why I Built This Project

This project was developed to demonstrate my skills in building a fully functional and responsive web application using modern web development tools. I chose React for its component-based architecture and state management, which simplifies the development of complex UIs. Vite was selected for its blazing-fast build times and smooth development experience.

### Why Tailwind CSS?

- **Utility-First Approach**: Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first approach, which means you can style your components directly in the JSX with predefined classes, making the development process faster and more efficient.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind's built-in responsive utilities allow you to easily create a design that looks great on all screen sizes.
- **Customizable**: Tailwind is highly customizable, allowing you to extend its default theme with custom values, ensuring your design system remains consistent throughout the project.

## Features

- **Responsive UI**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Product Display**: Browse through a list of products, each displayed with clear and concise information.
- **Modern Design**: The UI is clean, modern, and user-friendly, providing an enjoyable shopping experience.
